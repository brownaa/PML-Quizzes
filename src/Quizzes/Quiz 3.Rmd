# Question 1  
```{r}
#load the cell segmentation data
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(segmentationOriginal)
library(caret)
library(caTools)

set.seed(125)

split = sample.split(segmentationOriginal$Case, SplitRatio = 8/10)


```

#Question 2  
```{r}

```
Answer: There is a non-random pattern in the plot of the outcome versus index that does not appear to be perfectly explained by any predictor suggesting a variable may be missing.

#Question 3  
```{r}

```

Answer: There are a large number of values that are the same and even if you took the log(SuperPlasticizer + 1) they would still all be identical so the distribution would not be symmetric.

#Question 4  
```{r} 


```

Answer: `r a4$numComp`

#Question 5  
```{r}

```

Answer: Non-PCA accuracy: `r no.PCA.accuracy`  
            PCA accuracy: `r PCA.accuracy`
